# Mission statement:
Our mission is to design and implement a sustainable, livable urban environment in which cars are no longer the primary means of transportation. We endeavor to create a city that prioritizes the health and well-being of its citizens, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and protects the natural environment. By embracing innovative technologies and urban planning strategies, we aim to create an open source model for car-free city living that can be replicated around the world.

* City size: 500 to 750 acres growing over time to 40,000 to 60,000 residents
* Emphasis on communal spaces that encourage genuine human interactions and personal relationships

# Features of the car free city:

* Sufficient density; all areas should be accessible by bike or other last mile vehicle within 15 minutes

* A focus on creating vibrant, livable communities, with a mix of housing, commercial, and recreational spaces that support social interactions and a sense of belonging.

* A well-developed public transportation system, including trains, and other forms of mass transit, that provides reliable and convenient access to all parts of the city.

* An extensive network of bike paths and pedestrian-friendly streets, making it easy and safe for people to walk or bike to their destinations.

* A strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, with buildings and infrastructure designed to minimize their impact on the natural world.

* A commitment to keeping housing affordable for everyone in the community whether they work in a low wage occupation or otherwise.

* Ample community space such as public squares with plentiful restaurants and shops

* Space for community resources such as wood shops or metal shops for people to pursue crafts or repair belongings


# Our plan:

The board will of a group of individuals who are passionate about and committed to our mission. These individuals may be chosen for their expertise, experience, or connections, and they may serve on a voluntary or paid basis.
